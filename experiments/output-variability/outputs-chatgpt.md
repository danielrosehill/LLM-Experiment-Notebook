### Summary of Task
You are looking to set up automation so that whenever changes are pushed to a feeder repository, the root repository is notified, pulls in those changes into its `published` branch, and triggers the MK Docs build automatically on Netlify.

---

### Recommended Setup
To achieve this, I recommend using **GitHub Actions**, as it allows seamless automation for GitHub repositories without needing an external automation platform. GitHub Actions can handle webhook events, run scripts, and use secrets like `DEPLOY_PAT`.

---

### Steps to Configure the Automation

#### 1. **Set Up a Webhook in Feeder Repositories**
   - Navigate to your feeder repository (e.g., `My_Tech_Stack`) on GitHub.
   - Go to **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**.
   - Set the Payload URL to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow in your root repository:
     ```
     https://api.github.com/repos/danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo/dispatches
     ```
   - Set the content type to `application/json`.
   - Add a secret for security (you will use this in your root repo).
   - Choose the **push** event as the trigger.
   - Save the webhook.

---

#### 2. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow in the Root Repository**
   - In the root repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`), create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/pull_and_build.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: Update and Build Documentation

   on:
     repository_dispatch:
       types:
         - feeder_updated

   jobs:
     update_and_build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout the root repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             ref: published

         - name: Authenticate with GitHub
           run: echo "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}" | gh auth login --with-token
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}

         - name: Pull updates from feeder repositories
           run: |
             git submodule update --remote --merge
             git add .
             git commit -m "Update submodules after feeder change" || echo "No changes to commit"
             git push origin published

         - name: Trigger MK Docs build
           run: echo "MK Docs build will trigger automatically on Netlify."
   ```

   - Save this file to the root repository.

---

#### 3. **Link Feeder Repo Updates to the Root Repo Dispatch**
   - In the feeder repository (`My_Tech_Stack`), add a script or GitHub Actions workflow to notify the root repository whenever there are changes. For example:

   ```yaml
   name: Notify Root Repository

   on:
     push:

   jobs:
     notify:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Trigger root repository dispatch
           run: |
             curl -X POST \
               -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
               -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}" \
               https://api.github.com/repos/danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo/dispatches \
               -d '{"event_type": "feeder_updated"}'
   ```

   - Save this workflow in the feeder repository under `.github/workflows/notify_root.yml`.

---

### Final Workflow
1. **Developer Pushes to Feeder Repo:**
   - A webhook or GitHub Actions workflow in the feeder repo sends a `repository_dispatch` event to the root repo.

2. **Root Repository Pulls Updates:**
   - The root repository workflow triggers on the `repository_dispatch` event.
   - It updates the `published` branch with the latest submodule changes from the feeder repo.
   - It pushes those changes to `published`, which triggers the MK Docs build on Netlify.

---

### Notes
- The `DEPLOY_PAT` secret needs permissions for `repo` and `workflow` scopes to push updates and trigger actions.
- Ensure all feeder repositories have the correct submodule configuration in the root repository.
- Test each step of the workflow to validate functionality.

### Summary
You want to automate updates to a private MKDocs documentation repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`) whenever changes are pushed to a feeder repository (`My_Tech_Stack`). The automation should:
1. Notify the root repo when changes are pushed to a feeder repo.
2. Pull updates from feeder repositories into the `published` branch of the root repo.
3. Build the updated documentation (triggered by changes to the `published` branch).

### Recommendation
Using **GitHub Actions** is the simplest and most direct way to implement this workflow. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub and allows for the automation of repository updates without requiring an external platform.

### Plan and Steps to Configure

#### Step 1: Set up Webhook in the Feeder Repository
1. **Purpose**: Notify the root repository when changes are pushed to the feeder repo.
2. Go to the feeder repository (`My_Tech_Stack`):
   - Navigate to `Settings > Webhooks`.
   - Click `Add webhook`.
   - Set the **Payload URL** to a GitHub Actions-triggering endpoint (provided below).
   - Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
   - Choose **Just the push event**.
   - Add the webhook.

#### Step 2: Add a GitHub Actions Workflow in the Root Repository
1. In the `Documentation-Root-Repo` repository, create the following GitHub Actions workflow file:

   **File**: `.github/workflows/sync-published-branch.yml`
   ```yaml
   name: Sync Feeder Repositories

   on:
     workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering
     repository_dispatch: # Triggered by the webhook
       types: 
         - feeder-update

   jobs:
     update-documentation:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         # Step 1: Checkout the repository
         - name: Checkout Documentation Root Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             ref: published # Ensure you're working on the 'published' branch

         # Step 2: Pull updates from the feeder repo
         - name: Pull updates from feeder repositories
           run: |
             git submodule update --remote --merge
             git add .
             git commit -m "Update submodule(s) from feeder repository" || echo "No changes to commit"
             git push origin published

   ```

#### Step 3: Configure the Feeder Repo to Trigger the Workflow
To trigger the above workflow, configure a webhook in the feeder repository that sends a `repository_dispatch` event to the root repository. 

1. Generate a `repository_dispatch` token:
   - In the root repository, go to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`.
   - Add a new secret named `DEPLOY_PAT` with your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

2. Use the following script in the feeder repo to trigger the workflow when changes are pushed:

   **Script**: Add to `.github/workflows/notify-root-repo.yml`
   ```yaml
   name: Notify Root Repository

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main # Adjust to the default branch of the feeder repo

   jobs:
     notify-root-repo:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         # Trigger the repository_dispatch event in the root repository
         - name: Send repository_dispatch event
           run: |
             curl -X POST \
               -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
               -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}" \
               https://api.github.com/repos/danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo/dispatches \
               -d '{"event_type": "feeder-update"}'
   ```

3. Commit and push the workflow to your feeder repository.

#### Step 4: Confirm MKDocs Auto-Build on `published`
1. Ensure that MKDocs is configured to build automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `published` branch. Since this is already set up, you donâ€™t need to add additional triggers.

---

### Summary of Workflow
1. A `push` event in the feeder repo triggers the `notify-root-repo` workflow.
2. The feeder workflow sends a `repository_dispatch` event to the root repository.
3. The root repository workflow runs, updating submodules and pushing changes to the `published` branch.
4. MKDocs auto-builds the documentation based on the updated `published` branch.

This solution uses GitHub Actions exclusively, avoiding external dependencies and leveraging your existing GitHub infrastructure.

### Summary of Prompt:
You are using submodules to build a documentation repository hosted on GitHub and deployed on Netlify. You version documentation in feeder repositories, which are pulled into a main repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`) built with MkDocs. You want to automate the process of pulling changes from feeder repositories into the `published` branch of the main repository, building only when changes are pushed to the `published` branch.

---

### Recommended Setup:
To achieve this workflow, I recommend using **GitHub Actions** because:
- It integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories.
- It avoids external tools/platforms, reducing setup complexity and dependencies.
- GitHub Actions supports triggering workflows based on pushes to feeder repositories using webhook events.

---

### Configuration Steps:

#### 1. **Set Up the GitHub Actions Workflow in the Main Repository**
Add a GitHub Actions workflow file to the main repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`) that listens for changes in the feeder repository and performs the following:
1. Pulls the latest changes from the feeder repository.
2. Updates the `published` branch.
3. Pushes changes to the `published` branch.

Create the workflow file at `.github/workflows/update-docs.yml` in the `Documentation-Root-Repo`.

```yaml
name: Update Documentation from Feeder Repos

on:
  push:
    # Trigger when a change is pushed to a feeder repository (submodule branch)
    branches:
      - main # Adjust to the branch name of feeder repos if different

jobs:
  update-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the main repository
      - name: Checkout Root Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}
          submodules: true # Ensures feeder submodules are updated

      # Step 2: Pull latest changes for submodules
      - name: Update Submodules
        run: |
          git submodule update --remote
          git add .
          git commit -m "Update submodules" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push origin published

```

#### 2. **Configure the Feeder Repositories to Notify the Root Repository**
Set up a webhook in the feeder repositories to notify the root repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`) when changes are pushed.

1. Navigate to the feeder repository (`My_Tech_Stack`) on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook**.
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: Use the GitHub API endpoint for your repository, e.g., `https://api.github.com/repos/danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo/dispatches`
   - **Content Type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: (Optional) Add a secret for security.
   - **Events to Trigger**: Select `push`.

4. Add a GitHub PAT to the feeder repository webhook configuration for authentication. You can use the `DEPLOY_PAT` GitHub secret.

#### 3. **Configure the `published` Branch for Deployment**
The `published` branch of your root repository is already configured to trigger MkDocs builds on Netlify. Ensure:
- Your Netlify project is set to listen for changes on the `published` branch.
- MkDocs is configured correctly in the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root repository.

---

### Workflow Summary:
1. A change in a feeder repository triggers the webhook.
2. The webhook notifies the root repository via the GitHub API.
3. GitHub Actions in the root repository fetches and pulls the latest changes from feeder repositories and commits them to the `published` branch.
4. Netlify detects changes in the `published` branch and triggers an MkDocs build.

---

### Advantages of This Setup:
- Fully automated workflow within GitHub.
- GitHub Actions provides native support for submodules and authentication via secrets.
- Using webhooks ensures near-instant triggering of workflows.

### Summary
You want to automate the workflow where updates to feeder repositories notify a root documentation repository, triggering it to fetch the latest changes and update its `published` branch. The updated branch then automatically builds the site with MK Docs, deploying it via Netlify.

### Recommended Approach
Using **GitHub Actions** in the feeder repositories to notify and trigger updates in the root repository is the most straightforward and integrated solution. This approach ensures all automation stays within GitHub and uses its native tools.

---

### Workflow Setup
1. **Feeder Repository (e.g., `My_Tech_Stack`) Configuration**
   - Add a GitHub Actions workflow to send a webhook-like notification to the root repository when changes are pushed.

2. **Root Repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`) Configuration**
   - Add a GitHub Actions workflow to listen for incoming repository dispatch events and pull updates from the submodules.
   - Ensure the workflow updates the `published` branch upon receiving the event.

---

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. **Feeder Repository Workflow**
In the feeder repository (e.g., `My_Tech_Stack`), create the following workflow:

- **Path**: `.github/workflows/notify-root.yml`
- **Content**:
```yaml
name: Notify Root Repository

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust to match your primary branch in the feeder repo

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Trigger Root Repository Workflow
        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}
          repository: danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo
          event-type: feeder-update
          client-payload: '{"repository": "My_Tech_Stack"}'
```

This workflow triggers a custom GitHub repository dispatch event (`feeder-update`) in the root repository.

---

#### 2. **Root Repository Workflow**
In the root repository (`Documentation-Root-Repo`), create the following workflow:

- **Path**: `.github/workflows/sync-feeder-changes.yml`
- **Content**:
```yaml
name: Sync Feeder Changes

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - feeder-update

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Root Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}
          submodules: recursive  # Ensures all submodules are pulled

      - name: Fetch Updates from Submodules
        run: |
          git submodule update --remote --merge
          git add .
          git commit -m "Sync submodule updates from feeder repos" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push origin published
```

This workflow does the following:
- Listens for the `feeder-update` event.
- Updates all submodules in the root repository to their latest versions.
- Commits and pushes changes to the `published` branch.

---

### Explanation of Key Steps

### Summary of Your Workflow
You want to automate a documentation publishing pipeline using GitHub. Changes pushed to feeder repositories should notify the main repository (private `Documentation-Root-Repo`), which should:

1. Pull those changes into its `published` branch.
2. Trigger a build via MK Docs (already set up to build on `published` pushes).

---

### Recommendation
Use **GitHub Actions** to achieve this. It is native to GitHub, supports webhook triggers, and integrates seamlessly with repositories. Using GitHub Actions simplifies the setup, eliminates the need for external automation platforms, and ensures secure token management via `DEPLOY_PAT`.

---

### Steps to Configure the Automation

#### **1. Grant Access to Feeder Repository**
Ensure the feeder repo (`My_Tech_Stack`) has sufficient permissions to trigger workflows in the private root repository:
- Add `DEPLOY_PAT` as a secret in the feeder repo. 
  - Go to the feeder repo â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **New Repository Secret** â†’ Add `DEPLOY_PAT`.

#### **2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow in Feeder Repo**
Set up a GitHub Actions workflow in the feeder repo to notify the root repo of changes.

- **File Path:** `.github/workflows/notify-root-repo.yml`
- **Content:**

```yaml
name: Notify Root Repository

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust if using a different branch for updates

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify root repository
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"event_type": "pull-updates"}' \
          https://api.github.com/repos/danielrosehill/Documentation-Root-Repo/dispatches
```

This workflow triggers a `repository_dispatch` event in the root repo whenever changes are pushed to the feeder repo.

---

#### **3. Create GitHub Actions Workflow in Root Repo**
Set up a GitHub Actions workflow in the root repo to handle the `repository_dispatch` event and pull changes from feeder repos into the `published` branch.

- **File Path:** `.github/workflows/update-published.yml`
- **Content:**

```yaml
name: Pull Updates from Feeder Repositories

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - pull-updates

jobs:
  pull-updates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out root repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: published  # Target the published branch

      - name: Pull updates from feeder repositories
        run: |
          git submodule update --remote --merge
          git add .
          git commit -m "Updated submodules from feeder repositories" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push origin published
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}
```

This workflow does the following:
1. Checks out the `published` branch of the root repo.
2. Updates submodules with the latest changes from feeder repos.
3. Commits and pushes changes back to the `published` branch.

---

#### **4. Ensure Submodule Configuration**
Verify that your submodules are configured correctly in the root repo (`Documentation-Root-Repo`):
- Add submodules using:
  ```bash
  git submodule add https://github.com/danielrosehill/My_Tech_Stack.git <relative-path>
  git commit -m "Added My_Tech_Stack submodule"
  ```
- Push these changes to the `published` branch of the root repo.

---

### Final Workflow Summary
1. **Feeder Repo Workflow:** Pushes changes â†’ Sends `repository_dispatch` event to root repo.
2. **Root Repo Workflow:** Listens for `repository_dispatch` â†’ Updates submodules â†’ Pushes to `published` branch.
3. **MK Docs:** Automatically builds on `published` branch updates.

This approach is secure, integrates seamlessly with GitHub, and requires minimal maintenance. Let me know if you need further assistance!
