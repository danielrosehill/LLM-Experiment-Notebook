# Stratifying reactions to the ICC arrest warrants (Nov 2024)

This prompt and output chain was originally shared on my Israel GeoInsights repository and is one of a few prompt chains that I have put together to experiment with the idea that LLMs (enhanced with real time data retrieval capabilities) can mine openly accessible information to produce geopolitical analysis by identifying anomalies and patterns between recent developments and the baseline understanding of bilateral relations formed during their training period.

As subject matter, I chose the (now recent) announcement by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and (now former) Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant. I thought that this "incident" would be an interesting test case because:

- A couple of positions are clearly anomalous  
- I thought that reactions could probably be stratified based upon some commonality
- The news event was personally extremely interesting

This prompt chain was run on 23-Nov-24 using GPT-4o accessed via Perplexity AI. To control for any context being aggregated within interactions, a new conversation was begun with every prompt.

## Prompt 1

On November 21 2024 the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant.

World governmemts have reacted to the warrant in different ways.

Let's suppose that we wanted to categorise the reactions into 5 groups.

Each group represents broadly similar reactions between the constituent nations.

Your tasks:

1) Provide the 5 groups  
2) For each group, provide a short description of it  
3) For each group, provide examples of countries within that group, providing both their common name and their Alpha-2 identifier according to ISO-3166  

## Output 1

- **Description**: These nations and entities not only support the ICC's decision but also view it as a significant step toward justice for Palestinians. They encourage broader accountability for alleged war crimes.
- **Examples**:
  - Turkey (TR)
  - Iran (IR)

### **Group 5: Mixed or Neutral Reactions**
- **Description**: These countries have expressed mixed reactions, balancing respect for international law with concerns about political implications. Their positions may vary depending on alliances or domestic considerations.
- **Examples**:
  - Germany (DE)
  - Spain (ES)
  - Austria (AT)

## Prompt 2

The following table represents a categorisation system dividing world governments by how they reacted to the ICC arrest warrant issued against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant on November 21st.

Your tasks are as follows:

- 1: Analyse the table  
- 2: Identify anomalies

An "anomaly" in this context means: a country you would not have been expected to be in the category it belongs to according to this table.

For each anomaly that you identify explain why you consider it to be anomalous.

Here's the table:

`{Table from previous output}`

## Output 2

### Analysis of the Table and Identification of Anomalies

#### **1. Analysis of the Table**
The table categorizes countries based on their reactions to the ICC arrest warrants issued against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. The categories range from strong support for the ICC and enforcement (Group 1) to outright opposition (Group 3). There are also intermediate positions, such as hesitancy in enforcement (Group 2), mixed/neutral reactions (Group 5), and strong advocacy for justice specifically in favor of Palestinians (Group 4).

#### **2. Identified Anomalies and Explanations**

1. **South Africa (ZA) in Group 1 (Supportive of ICC and Committed to Enforcement)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: While South Africa has historically supported international justice mechanisms like the ICC, its prior reluctance to enforce ICC warrants—such as its failure to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2015—makes its placement in Group 1 surprising. This suggests a significant shift in its stance or a unique emphasis on this particular case.

2. **Turkey (TR) in Group 4 (Strongly Supportive of ICC Decision)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: Turkey is not a member of the ICC and has previously been critical of international judicial bodies when they conflict with its national interests. Its strong support for the ICC decision here likely stems from its political alignment with Palestinian causes rather than a broader endorsement of the ICC’s authority.

3. **United Kingdom (GB) in Group 2 (Respectful of ICC but Hesitant on Enforcement)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: The UK has traditionally been a strong advocate for international law and justice, often aligning closely with Group 1 countries like France and the Netherlands. Its hesitancy on enforcement may reflect political considerations, such as maintaining its relationship with Israel or navigating post-Brexit foreign policy complexities.

4. **Hungary (HU) in Group 3 (Opposed to ICC Decision)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: Hungary’s placement here is notable because, as an EU member state, it is generally expected to align with broader European support for international law and justice mechanisms. Its opposition likely reflects Hungary’s increasingly nationalist and pro-Israel foreign policy under Viktor Orbán.

5. **Germany (DE) in Group 5 (Mixed or Neutral Reactions)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: Germany is a staunch supporter of international law and has consistently backed the ICC. Its neutral stance here may be influenced by its historical relationship with Israel, balancing its commitment to justice with sensitivity toward Israeli concerns.

6. **Iran (IR) in Group 4 (Strongly Supportive of ICC Decision)**  
   - **Why it’s anomalous**: Iran is not a party to the Rome Statute that governs the ICC and has historically been critical of Western-led international institutions. Its strong support for this decision likely reflects its geopolitical rivalry with Israel rather than a principled endorsement of the ICC.

#### Summary
The anomalies identified highlight instances where countries' positions deviate from their historical patterns or expected alignments based on political, legal, or geopolitical factors.

## Prompt 3 (Not Chained)

The following table provides a summary of how countries reacted to the ICC's recent arrest warrant issued against Netanyahu and Gallant.

Which reactions would you regard as particularly noteworthy.

Within this context, noteworthy can be considered synonymous with:

- Unexpected  
- Departing from the consensus exhibited by its usual geopolitical group

Here's the table:

`{Table from previous output}`

## Output 3

### Noteworthy Reactions to the ICC Arrest Warrant Against Netanyahu and Gallant

The following reactions stand out as particularly noteworthy due to their **unexpected nature** or **departure from the usual consensus of their geopolitical group**:

1. **South Africa (ZA)** in Group 1: 
   - South Africa's strong support for the ICC and commitment to enforce the arrest warrants is noteworthy. While South Africa is a signatory to the ICC, its past reluctance to enforce similar warrants (e.g., for Sudan's Omar al-Bashir) suggests a shift in its stance, possibly reflecting a stronger emphasis on international justice in this case.

2. **Turkey (TR)** in Group 4:
   - Turkey's strong support for the ICC decision is surprising given its historically tense relationship with international judicial bodies and its own contentious record on human rights. This position notably diverges from many NATO allies, which are more cautious or opposed to enforcement.

3. **Hungary (HU)** in Group 3:
   - Hungary's outright opposition to the ICC decision is unexpected within the European Union, where most member states either support or respect the ICC's role. This highlights Hungary's increasingly divergent foreign policy under Viktor Orbán, aligning more closely with Israel and the United States.

4. **Germany (DE)** in Group 5:
   - Germany’s mixed or neutral reaction is striking, as it is traditionally a staunch supporter of international law and the ICC. Its hesitancy may reflect domestic political considerations or its strong ties with Israel, marking a departure from its usual alignment with other Western European nations like France or Belgium.

5. **Iran (IR)** in Group 4:
   - Iran’s strong support for the ICC decision is notable given that it is not a party to the Rome Statute (the treaty establishing the ICC). This position likely stems from its adversarial relationship with Israel rather than a broader endorsement of the ICC’s authority.
