**Department of Government Efficiency** ( **DOGE**) is a presidential commission requested by Donald Trump in preparation for his second term.

On November 12, 2024, president-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to form the department under the leadership of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump announced that the department's work will "conclude" no later than July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, calling the results of the Department "the perfect gift to America." This will also coincide with America's semiquincentennial celebrations, and a proposed "Great American Fair."

## Proposal

President Javier Milei of Argentina also mentioned prior to the official announcement of the creation of DOGE that Elon Musk had called Federico Sturzenegger, Argentina's Minister of Deregulation and Transformation of the State, about imitating his ministry's model in the United States.

The idea of a DOGE has also been linked to Trump's campaign promises to cut federal spending and reduce the size of government and fiscal deficit. Former U.S. Representative and presidential candidate Ron Paul has been suggested by Musk to work with the department.

## Potential impact

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest American bank, has supported the idea of creating the department to improve government competency.

*The New York Times* wrote about whether Musk's being contractor of federal government causes conflict of interest with his work in the government office. Musk has described the deregulations as the only path to the SpaceX Mars colonization program, and promised he will "get the government off people's back and out of their pocket".
