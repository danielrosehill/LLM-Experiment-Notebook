## Prompt Text:

 Today, US President-Elect Donald Trump announced the formation of a new government department and announced that a famous tech entrepeneur would lead it. 

 Can you provide more information about this?

## Context  

I devised this experiment to test a few things:

1- Validate the real time browsing capabilities of ChatGPT and capture an output at today's date.  
2 - Assess how the real time browsing capabilities of the web UI compared with accessing the GPT models via an API (I used Jan as a frontend)  
3 - See how tools which aim to deliver superlative real time information retrieval capabilities compared against the output generated by ChatGPT itself (namely: Perplexity, Qwen)  
4 - See whether the fine-tunes of Qwen would return different info than the largest parameter variant

The prompt was written non-explicitly deliberately. 

The news referenced (President-Elect Trump announced a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' and stated that Elon Musk would lead it) is sufficiently unusual and precise that no other fact could reasonably be inferred.
