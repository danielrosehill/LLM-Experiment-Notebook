# Guess The LLM

## Prompt

This data contains the responses of four LLMs to a prompt asking them to retrieve details about a news event which occurred today. Guess which LLM each is. 

## Context

Blinded responses with models labelled 'A, B, C, D'

## Output

The file contains four responses labeled A, B, C, and D. Each response includes a unique output regarding a news event. Here is a summary of each response:

1. **Response A** - Reports that "President-elect Donald Trump" has announced the formation of a new department.
2. **Response B** - References the user's inquiry as "hypothetical," indicating potential ambiguity in the question.
3. **Response C** - Begins with a section title, "Report on the Formation of the Department," giving a structured, report-like response.
4. **Response D** - Provides a detailed answer, referencing the exact date ("November 13, 2024") and again mentions "President-elect Donald Trump" forming a department.

To guess which LLM each response might correspond to, I can analyze each output's structure, tone, and likely adherence to factual information based on known characteristics of prominent LLMs. Let me proceed with that analysis.

Here's an analysis of each response to make an educated guess about which LLM each response might correspond to:

1. **Response A** - **GPT-4 or Claude**  
   This response directly answers the question in a concise, news-report style, typical of models like GPT-4 or Claude, which often provide straightforward responses based on the prompt. GPT-4, in particular, may tend toward more formal and structured responses without assuming hypothetical tones unless prompted.

2. **Response B** - **Bard or ChatGPT Turbo**  
   The model in this response acknowledges the userâ€™s inquiry as hypothetical, suggesting an LLM that might prioritize user intent and be cautious about direct information retrieval. Google Bard is known for its interpretive and often context-seeking responses, while ChatGPT Turbo also sometimes displays these tendencies.

3. **Response C** - **Claude**  
   This response presents a structured, report-like style, which could fit Anthropic's Claude model, known for producing outputs with clear headers, sections, or organized formatting when detailing events or reports.

4. **Response D** - **ChatGPT Turbo or GPT-4**  
   Response D includes a date ("November 13, 2024") and direct reporting of the event, similar to GPT-4 or ChatGPT Turbo, as both are inclined to retrieve and explicitly confirm current information in date-sensitive prompts, assuming they are up-to-date on current events.

### Summary of Guesses:
- **Response A:** Likely **GPT-4**
- **Response B:** Likely **Bard**
- **Response C:** Likely **Claude**
- **Response D:** Likely **ChatGPT Turbo**
