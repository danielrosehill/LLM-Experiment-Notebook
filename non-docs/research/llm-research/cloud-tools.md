# Prompt

Sometimes, I like to compare different LLMs to see how they perform for a particular prompt (or prompting strategy). I believe that there are tools for exactly this purpose. Can you provide a list of some of them?

You are interested in tools that allow you to compare outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) based on a single prompt. Here is a list of some of the most popular tools designed for this purpose:

## **1. Nat.dev**
Nat.dev is one of the most well-known platforms for comparing LLMs. It allows users to input a prompt and view side-by-side outputs from different models like GPT-4, Claude, and others. It also offers customization options such as adjusting model parameters (e.g., temperature) to see how different settings affect the results[1][4][7].

## **2. Chatbot Arena**
Developed by LMSYS, Chatbot Arena lets users compare multiple LLMs by inputting a single prompt and viewing the responses side-by-side. The platform currently supports over 80 models and is frequently updated with new ones, making it a great option for real-time comparisons[4].

## **3. LangChain's Model Laboratory**
LangChain provides built-in support for comparing LLM outputs through its Model Laboratory feature. This tool allows users to run experiments with different models and prompts, making it easy to iterate and evaluate performance across various LLMs[1].

## **4. Hugging Face Model Hub**
Hugging Face offers a wide range of models that can be compared side-by-side using their platform. They provide evaluation metrics and allow users to test different models on various tasks, such as text generation or question answering.

## **5. ModelBench.ai**
ModelBench.ai is designed specifically for evaluating LLMs. It allows users to write prompts, design tests, and run benchmarks across many models, providing detailed insights into performance metrics like cost and latency[1].

## **6. Multi-Chat (AI-Pro)**
AI-Proâ€™s Multi-Chat tool enables users to input a single prompt and receive outputs from multiple LLMs simultaneously. This makes it easier to compare responses in real-time and evaluate which model performs best for specific tasks[4].

## **7. Vercel AI SDK**
Vercel's SDK allows for side-by-side comparison of text generation models, including those from Hugging Face and other open-source platforms. It is simple to use and integrates well with existing workflows[1][7].

## **8. OpenLIT**
OpenLIT is an open-source tool that provides side-by-side comparisons of LLMs based on response quality, cost, and latency. It is self-hosted and focuses on observability and evaluation of LLM performance[1].

## **9. DeepEval**
DeepEval is an open-source framework offering a wide range of evaluation metrics such as hallucination detection, contextual relevancy, and answer faithfulness. It is highly customizable and integrates easily into existing machine learning pipelines[5].

## **10. ChatLabs**
ChatLabs offers extensive comparison features for various LLMs, including Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4 Turbo, and others. It provides detailed metrics on accuracy, tokens used, price per query, and speed[4].

These tools can help you systematically compare different LLMs based on your specific needs or prompting strategies.
