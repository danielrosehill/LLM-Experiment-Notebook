# Prompt

Are there any tools for comparing the performance of two (or more) locally hosted LLMs for the same prompt?

To compare the performance of two or more locally hosted large language models (LLMs) for the same prompt, several tools and frameworks are available. These tools allow you to systematically evaluate LLMs based on various metrics like accuracy, speed, memory usage, and output quality. Below are some key tools and methods that can help with this task:

## **1. DeepEval**
DeepEval is an open-source framework designed specifically for evaluating LLM applications. It supports over 14 research-backed metrics, including contextual recall, answer relevance, and faithfulness. DeepEval can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, making it suitable for automated testing and comparison of LLMs. It allows you to test LLM performance across different frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, making it versatile for local model comparisons[8].

## **2. Promptfoo**
Promptfoo is another tool that helps in systematically testing prompts across different models. It allows you to run predefined tests on multiple LLMs and compare their outputs based on various metrics such as correctness, relevance, and hallucination tendencies[12]. This tool is particularly useful if you want to compare how different models respond to the same set of prompts.

## **3. LMSYS Chatbot Arena**
Chatbot Arena is a benchmarking platform that enables side-by-side comparisons of LLMs by pitting them against each other in anonymous battles. Users can input a prompt, receive responses from two anonymous models, and then vote on which model performed better. This approach provides a user-centric evaluation method while also offering quantitative metrics like Elo ratings for ranking models[7].

## **4. Language Model Evaluation Harness (EleutherAI)**
This framework provides a unified API for benchmarking LLMs across a wide range of tasks and datasets. It supports different backends (e.g., VLLM, GGUF), allowing you to easily switch between models for comparison purposes. The framework includes standard benchmarks like HellaSwag and MMLU, making it ideal for comparing the general capabilities of multiple models[7].

## **5. UpTrain**
UpTrain is an open-source evaluation tool that provides pre-built metrics to evaluate LLM responses on aspects such as correctness, hallucination, and toxicity[12]. It offers an API client that can be used to run experiments on local models and compare their performance across multiple dimensions.

## **6. HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)**
HELM provides a comprehensive benchmarking suite that evaluates LLMs on various metrics like accuracy, robustness, fairness, and efficiency[2]. While HELM is typically used for cloud-based models, its methodology can be adapted for locally hosted models as well.

## **7. LlamaIndex**
LlamaIndex offers modules specifically designed to evaluate LLM-generated responses based on criteria such as semantic similarity, faithfulness to retrieved contexts, and relevance to the query[9]. This tool can be particularly useful when comparing how well different models handle retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

### **Key Metrics for Comparison:**
- **Accuracy**: How well the model answers factual questions.
- **Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence.
- **Response Time**: How quickly the model generates a response.
- **Memory Usage**: How much memory the model consumes during inference.
- **Relevance**: How relevant the generated response is to the prompt.
- **Hallucination Index**: Measures how much false information the model generates.
- **Toxicity**: Evaluates whether any harmful or offensive language is generated.

### **Conclusion**
To compare locally hosted LLMs effectively, tools like DeepEval, Promptfoo, LMSYS Chatbot Arena, and UpTrain offer robust frameworks for evaluating model performance across various dimensions. These tools allow you to test multiple prompts systematically and obtain quantitative metrics that help in making informed decisions about which model performs better for your specific use case.
